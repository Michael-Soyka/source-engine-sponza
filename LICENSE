Modified the model from Crytek's OBJ
export to correct some small errors. He computed bump maps from the
normal maps using <a href="http://cs.williams.edu/~morgan/code/">normal2bump.cpp</a>
(since MTL files expect height bumps, not normals), put the "mask" textures
into the alpha channel of the associated diffuse texture, cleaned up
noise in the masks, created the missing gi_flag.tga texture, and
removed the long untextured banner floating in the middle of the
atrium that appears in the file but in none of the published images of
the model. The banner is in banner.obj.

### Copyright (c) August 19, 2010 Sponza Model
The Atrium Sponza Palace, Dubrovnik, is an elegant and improved model created by Frank Meinl.
The original Sponza model was created by Marko Dabrovic in early 2002. Over the years,
the Sponza Atrium scene has become one of the most popular 3D scenes for testing global illumination
and radiosity due to it's specific architectural structure which is particularly complex for global illumination light.

However, nowadays it is considered as a simple model, thus it was decided to crate a new model with highly
improved appearance and scene complexity. It is donated to the public for radiosity and is represented in
several different formats (3ds, Obj) for use with various commercial 3D applications and renderers.
